            <div class="grab" id="daario-naharis"><p>All members of the team participated in the live show as performers, enhancing the reality and the feeling of vulnerability. I took part in a duet wherein my task was to use chalk to trace Mariah as she constantly shifted poses upon a drawing surface. The simple task, inherently void of personal connection resulted in unexpected and intimate moments of contact. </p></div>

            <div class="grab" id="daario-naharis"><p>As visual directors, our goal was to create something that addressed all the aspects one experiences in the arc of a relationship: from butterflies to discovering someone is different than expected, truly learning to know someone, and then deciding to make it work or break up. The visuals were a mixture of prepared and procedurally generated.</p></div> 
            
            <div class="grab" id="daario-naharis"><p><a href="http://kolosk.us" target="_blank">Jack Koloskus</a> and I were recruited by Gwendolyn Gussman to direct the visual aspects of a multi-sensory performance piece she was concocting. The theme of the piece was the question "What does it feel like to fall in love?" The show took place in the historic fleming mansion in Denver, an unconventional space, but one chosen for its intimacy and our ability to move through rooms and change the show accordingly.</p></div>
