                Binaries is a collaboration between me and my Grandmother, Linda Melvin Graham, which was shown at <a href="http://icecubegallery.com/" target="_blank">Ice Cube Gallery</a> in July of 2015. We explored the effects of humans on the planet and the possible resulting mass extinction.<br><br>

One of the main ideas is that life is resilient and has a tendency to continue in some form. The show featured a short film (entitled "Transitions") by yours truly, depicting an optimistic, interplanetary future for humans.
